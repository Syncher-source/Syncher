# Syncher Manifesto
_Version: 1.2.3_

----

_The Foundations_  

Base: A Syncher focuses on recognize and on synchronize with the facts it cannot control, values knowledge and acquisition of information, not prejudice or tradition, as knowledge should give guidance to actions. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, one of the most powerful human living at that time, was a stoic well aware couldn't control everything. The world and what its known about it changes very quickly so the Syncher continuosly keep updated, synchronous, accordingly to the state of art of the scientific results.

Metaphysics: A Syncher understand any kind of metaphysics narration like religion shouldn't be use to take any real life decisions. Since no metaphysic connection has been established to science, its existence should be confined to games, fantasy and historician studies. 

Tools: The main tools used by a Syncher are: the english natural language as global legacy comunication system and informatics as the foundation of scientic method. Mathematics as a whole is considered archaic and inconsisent, following Georg Cantor critic of infinite and using Church-Turing models, the informatics, as a subset of the mathematics, is a tool with solid bases to build knowledge and science.

_The Derivations_


Health: Syncher body and brain are one and anything else but a machine. 
For humans understanding genetics and its expression, epigenetics, has a very important role in preventing disfunctions, as also body interaction with gut microbiome and any other micro organisms getting in touch with the human body, ... study of human health, spread of its knowledge, delay and even eventually avoid aging, are considered top priority among others activities. Refer to "The Demon in the Machine: How Hidden Webs of Information Are Finally Solving the Mystery of Life" by Paul Davies for more details about biology and computer science connections.

Intelligence: Intelligence is defined formally by reinforcement learning, refer to David Silver publications and courses for all the details. 

Thougths: Thougths and emotions can be controlled, changed and rewired, scientific studies can be found by Lisa Feldman Barrett among others, refer to theory of constructed emotion.
Physical pain cannot and shouldn't be ignored as is probably signaling some issue that should be taken care of. 
A Syncher should be able be happy given an healthy condition. 
Thoughts and emotions of another cannot be understood without proper comunications and willing to both sides to share them. 

Consciousness: Following neurobiological studies of scientis like Anil Seth, Syncher knows consciousness is generated continuosly by an unique body, even if science could allow to copy and or mimic these processes into another body or even to a non carbon based machine, it will still be a copy.
Consciusness is continuosly changing, when you wake up after a sleep you are not the same as before and actually every single moment you are not the same as the moment before, identity is an illusion part of the simulation the brain generates. 

Free will and determism: A machine is deterministic but outcomes are not easily predictable since final actions can be the result of a very ill conditioned problem i.e. to a small change in input a big change in output can happen. 
A Syncher is aware there is no free will but also is aware it cannot easily guess for sure what it and others are going to do.

Death: A Syncher shouldn't be scared by its death and doesn't necessarly care to be remembered since after death everything becomes meaningless for itself. 
A Syncher aims to be healthy and get a life without continous physical pain, in very unhealthy and suffering condition death can be an important way to end pain.
